Write a function multiplyWithCallback that accepts two numbers and a callback function as arguments. The function should multiply the two numbers and pass the result to the callback function.----DONE


Write a function doAsyncOperation that simulates an asynchronous operation. It takes a callback function callback as an argument. Inside doAsyncOperation, perform a setTimeout for 2 seconds and then invoke the callback with a success message.----DONE


Write a function delay that returns a promise. The promise should resolve after a given number of milliseconds (delayTime) with the message "Resolved after X milliseconds", where X is delayTime. Pass delayTime as an argument  --- DONE


Write a function fetchData that fetches data from a mock API. Implement using promises:
If the request is successful, return the data.
If there's an error (e.g., status code is not 200), throw an error.


Write a function using async/await to fetch data from a REST API endpoint (https://api.example.com/data). Parse the JSON response and return the result.


Write a function that performs three asynchronous tasks sequentially using async/await:
Task 1: Fetch data from https://api.example.com/task1.
Task 2: Process the data (e.g., filter or transform it).
Task 3: Post the processed data to https://api.example.com/task3. Ensure each task waits for the previous one to complete before proceeding.


Write an async function that fetches data from multiple endpoints in parallel:
https://api.example.com/data1
https://api.example.com/data2 Ensure that the function waits for all requests to complete and collects all the results before returning.
